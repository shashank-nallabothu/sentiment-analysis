# 📊 Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT

This project builds a real-time **Sentiment Classification** system using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model on Amazon Reviews. It includes:

- A transformer-based model trained on 160K balanced reviews  
- A baseline model using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression  
- A **Streamlit app** for live predictions  
- Docker support for easy deployment

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved F1 score of **0.943** on validation set
- **Interactive UI**: Enter text, get prediction and confidence score
- **Lightweight API**: Runs via Streamlit with Dockerized setup
- **Baseline Comparison**: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression for reference

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Base: `distilbert-base-uncased`
- Fine-tuned for binary classification (positive/negative)
- Early stopping based on validation F1 score
- Trained using Hugging Face `Trainer`
